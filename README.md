🌐 Campus Navigation & Utility Planner
🚀 Data Structures Project – Trees & Graph Algorithms (Java)

A complete campus navigation system built using BST, AVL, Graphs, Dijkstra, Kruskal, and Expression Trees.
This project models university buildings, finds optimal paths, and generates utility layouts.

✨ Features
🌲 Tree Structures

📌 Binary Search Tree (BST) for storing building records

⚖️ AVL Tree for auto-balancing

🔍 Inorder, Preorder, Postorder Traversals

📏 Height comparison (BST vs AVL)

🗺️ Graph-Based Campus Map

🏛️ Each building is a node

🔗 Paths between buildings act as weighted edges

📘 Adjacency List + 🧮 Adjacency Matrix

🔄 BFS & DFS Traversals

🎯 Dijkstra Algorithm → Shortest Route

⚡ Kruskal MST → Minimum Utility Layout

🧮 Expression Tree

Builds expression tree from postfix format

Evaluates energy/utility cost expressions

📸 Example Outputs
