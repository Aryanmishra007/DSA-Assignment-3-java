This project is a Java implementation of a campus navigation and data management system using core Data Structures.
It includes tree structures for storing building information and graph algorithms for finding routes and planning utilities inside a campus.

Features
1. Building Management (Trees)

Stores building details using a Binary Search Tree (BST)

Self-balancing AVL Tree for better performance

Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals

Height comparison between BST and AVL

2. Campus Graph

Represents campus buildings as graph nodes

Weighted edges represent distances between buildings

Adjacency List + Adjacency Matrix representations

BFS and DFS traversals

Shortest path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Minimum cable layout using Kruskal’s MST

3. Expression Tree

Builds and evaluates an expression tree

Used for sample energy bill calculations

Output Includes

BST Traversals

AVL Traversals

BST vs AVL height comparison

BFS and DFS order

Shortest path between buildings

MST edges with total cost

Expression evaluation result
